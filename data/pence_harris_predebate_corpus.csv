What a fighter we have in Congresswoman Titus. Thank you all. Thank you everybody. Oh wow. Okay. First of all, there are so many incredible leaders who are part of this afternoon and who have been a part of this campaign from the beginning. And we’re going to count on them to lead us through these next 32 days to victory, but I want to thank them. [Shelby Parks 00:00:09:08], our field organizer. The great Governor Steve Sisolak. I was just hanging out with him behind the stage. Of course, Congresswoman Titus for all that she does. She is just a fighter in Washington. Senators Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto.

There we go. There is so much at stake in this election. There is so much at stake and we’ve got 32 days to get this done. And we’re going to get it done. And here’s the thing, this campaign, our campaign, as Joe says, is about fighting for the soul of our nation. And when we talk about, when Joe talks about fighting for the soul of our nation, it’s about fighting for working people. It’s about fighting for families. It’s about fighting for children. It’s about fighting for healthcare. It’s about fighting for good union jobs. It’s about fighting to preserve our climate and clean air and clean water.

Kamala Harris,00:11:06,"We are here fighting for the soul of our nation, saying yes, we can get criminal justice reform and policing reform. Yes, we can do what is necessary to bring healthcare to everybody because we believe access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. These are the things that are on the line in this election, and we’ve got 32 days to get it done. And I don’t need to tell my cousins in Nevada about the change we see coming with the work we are doing. The change we see coming when we know here in Nevada, we have the highest unemployment of any state in the country. When there has been incredible devastation because of a failure of an administration to take seriously a public health crisis and then do what is necessary to support working people. But we see the change coming, but we know it will not come without our investment in this fight.

Kamala Harris,00:12:23,"Our campaign and the work, the hard work, the sacrifice we will make over the next 32 days is born out of knowing what is possible. And that is so much bigger than fighting against something. It’s about the fight we’re in for something, for the people, all the people. That’s what our fight is about. And the thing about it, and this is what I love about Joe. You can talk about how you measure strength. Some people say, “Well, look at my muscles.” Yeah, that might be one way. But the thing that I love about Joe, he could also say, “Yeah, look at my muscles,” but the thing about Joe is that he understands the greatest strength that any of us, that any human being has is displayed when we lift up the condition of other people. That’s the strength of who we are. The strength of who we are. And therefore the power of the people is knowing then when we are together, when we are joined, when we are unified, when we don’t allow people to try and divide us and turn on each other, we are strong.

Don’t let any circumstance make you feel isolated because we are all in this together. We are all in this together. But to achieve the change we can see coming, we got to vote. We got to vote. And so what do we want to do? Honk if you’re going to vote early. Honk if you’re going to vote by mail. Honk if you’re going to make sure at least five people you know are going to vote. 10 people you know. And here’s the thing, none of us are immune. We’ve been reading it. We know what’s going on around the country. There’s some powerful people in our country that are trying to make it difficult for folks to vote. Did you guys see what happened in Texas yesterday? The governor of Texas, the Republican governor of Texas basically started getting rid of the drop boxes in Texas. Yeah.

Kamala Harris,00:15:20,"So here’s the thing, the right to vote, the right to vote was a hard fought and a hard won right. In fact, one of the biggest events that I attended before the pandemic struck was to walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama with now the great ancestor, John Lewis, who shed his blood on that bridge for the right for folks to vote. We honor the ancestors when we vote. Just last month, we celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, when those suffragettes, those powerful women marched and fought for the right for women in America to vote. We also recognize that it wasn’t until 1965 that black women could vote. So we know there is still work to do in that we are a country of work in progress. But this is the history of our right to vote.

Kamala Harris,00:16:34,"But we know there are obstacles around the country being put in our way. We know there are powerful people trying to suggest that you can’t trust the process, trying to suggest it’s rigged or it’s this or it’s that, but we know better. We know better. And here’s the thing I want to also point out. At some point, in addition to voting, it’s got to be about honoring the ancestors. And in addition to voting, it has to be about knowing what’s at stake. And also we got to just sit back sometimes and ask, why are so many powerful people trying to mess with our right to vote? Just sit back and ask that for a minute. Why are so many powerful people going through such difficulty to try and mess with our right to vote? And here’s what I believe the answer is.

This historic, this legendary business that you have been running as a family for 53 years, we spoke earlier, and this is just true of so many of our businesses, but in particular, this business, which is that our business leaders are, they are leaders in business, but they’re so much more than that. They are civic leaders, community leaders, role models, the people who nurture and who take care of the community, and create a warm and safe place for folks to go.

We are all members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and they, each of them, are powerful, powerful voices, not only for the people of North Carolina, but for all people in our country, so I want to in their absence thank them.

Kamala Harris,00:03:08,"So listen, I wanted to be here in Raleigh and North Carolina as one of the first trips that I’ve taken now officially on the ticket as the vice presidential nominee, because one, I love North Carolina, and it’s so great to come back. But two, there is so much about what happens in North Carolina as a bellwether, as a measure for what’s going on in our country, both in terms of its historical strengths, but also in terms of the challenges. The other thing we know about North Carolina is this. North Carolina is a road to the White House. There is no question about that. North Carolina is a road to reaching majority in the United States Senate, where I now serve. There’s no question about that. And so it is you, the leaders of North Carolina, that are going to make a difference, and make a decision that is not only about the people of this state, but the people of our nation, because with you, when you drop that ballot in that box, or walk into the polling station, with you, you will carry the future of so many others.",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-campaign-roundtable-transcript-in-north-carolina-september-28,Harris,"So listen, I wanted to be here in Raleigh and North Carolina as one of the first trips that I’ve taken now officially on the ticket as the vice presidential nominee, because one, I love North Carolina, and it’s so great to come back.

Kamala Harris,00:05:29,"That’s a wonderful question. And it really does highlight what’s at stake in the outcome of this election in so many ways. So let’s start with one of the crises that we’re facing as a country, which is the COVID pandemic. I think of it both as a crisis that is about a public health crisis. I think of it as an economic crisis. And in many ways, it is about the crisis of long-standing disparities in our country that have been only exasperated, only highlighted, which speaks to the crisis of systemic racism in our country.",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-campaign-roundtable-transcript-in-north-carolina-september-28,Harris,"That’s a wonderful question.

Kamala Harris,00:06:08,"So on your point, right now we are looking at the fact that Black folks and Latinos are three times as likely to contract this virus, and equally three times as likely and twice as likely to die from it. And when we look at those disparities, we know that it’s connected with the fact that there’s a reflection between those numbers and the preexisting conditions that existed before the virus hit. This virus is a predator in many ways. It preys on people who have preexisting conditions. So when you look at the Latino community, when you look at the Black community, and you know that similar in many cases, in terms of the preexisting conditions, things like high blood pressure, things like diabetes, are real. And so part of the perspective that Joe and I share is one to acknowledge those racial disparities and then address them. And that’s about a plan that we have, for example. By the way, Donald Trump has no plan. Let’s just start there. So it’s not even like we’re contrasting plans. He actually does not have a plan. But our plan, which includes what we need to do around testing, around treatment, and I pray every night that we get a vaccine as soon as possible that is safe, and about distribution of that vaccine. It’s about addressing the fact that we need to grow what Barack Obama and Joe Biden created with the Affordable Care Act.",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-campaign-roundtable-transcript-in-north-carolina-september-28,Harris,"So on your point, right now we are looking at the fact that Black folks and Latinos are three times as likely to contract this virus, and equally three times as likely and twice as likely to die from it.

That’s called mental health care, which particularly is an issue for us in our Latino and our Black communities, especially when you look at the high rates of undiagnosed and untreated trauma, right? I mean, think about it for a moment. Just step back on that point. Poverty is trauma inducing. We need to diagnose and we need to treat it.

But one of the issues is what is a challenge in terms of access to capital. So the Whites, I’m sure they have long stories about what they did to be smart around acquiring capital to build up your business, knowing that a lot of the traditional sources of access to capital were unavailable, and still are unavailable, to Black and Brown communities.

Kamala Harris,00:09:35,"So those are a couple of things. I can go into the topic of criminal justice. I think we’re going to talk about that in a minute. Education, the disparities there. You look at the fact that our children are supposed to be learning from home right now, but in poor communities, in Black and Brown communities, urban communities, as well as rural communities, access to broadband is a real issue. I know it’s a real issue here in North Carolina. We’re talking about how our children should be learning from home, but first of all, that requires that you have affordable access to broadband, if you have access at all. Then, if you have more than one child, do you have access to the technology? Are you going to have that many laptops? So many of our families who have access to wifi, it’s on their cell phone. A child can’t learn remotely on a cell phone. These are real issues that will have longterm impact on our communities, if we don’t see it and address it. And that’s part of the plan we have.

One of the things that Joe Biden feels strongly about is we need to have basically, a national center where we are keeping the names and keeping track of police officers who have broken the rules and broken the law."

Meaning, people are sitting in jail because they don’t have the money to get out. Meanwhile, the person who has been charged with the same offense and has money, is out exercising freewill, and liberty, right? Out there, they’re able to walk the streets.

Kamala Harris,00:15:41,"Thank you. Thank you for that question. So let’s start with police brutality. I was a prosecutor in my career and I’m going to tell you one of the problems. One of the problems with the criminal justice system is that there’s a phrase that is often used in the criminal justice system, and the phrase is accountability and consequence. There needs to be accountability and consequence. But the term is always used in connection with the person who was arrested and never in the context of the system itself and the actors within the system. And that’s part of the problem on this issue, there has not been consequence and accountability for police officers who break the rules and break the law consistent with those who do. So there are a number of things that we need to do to address it. For Joe and I, it includes we need to end choke holds and carotid holds. George Floyd would be alive today.",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-shop-talk-campaign-visit-detroit-michigan-transcript-september-22,Harris,"Thank you.

Kamala Harris,00:16:45,"It means there needs to be a national standard for police use of force. In many places, the question when there’s an excessive use of force is to ask, was that use of force reasonable? Well as we all know, you can reason away just about anything. The just and right question to ask was, was that use of force necessary? We are going to put in place a national registry. Why? Well, because often when there is any accountability and consequence for a police officer who breaks the rules and breaks the law, it is administrative. It doesn’t go to court because often the standards are just so high that they don’t take them to court, and that’s why we want to change the standards. But it goes through an administrative hearing. So what ends up happening, maybe that officer gets fired. Then they can pick up and move to another jurisdiction and their record doesn’t follow them. And so we need to have a standard.",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-shop-talk-campaign-visit-detroit-michigan-transcript-september-22,Harris,"It means there needs to be a national standard for police use of force.

Kamala Harris,00:17:43,"We need to also take the profit out of the criminal justice system. So what am I talking about? One, private prisons. And we will eliminate private prisons. Think about the business model of a private prison, is that some human beings are making a bunch of money off the incarceration of other human beings. That needs to end. We will end cash bail. I have been a leader on ending cash bail in the United States Senate. Why? Because there are people sitting in jail simply because they don’t have the money to pay bail. That’s wrong, because that’s an economic justice issue as much as it is a criminal justice issue. You’re saying that people are going to be incarcerated because they don’t have enough money in their back pocket? We need to end cash bail in America. So these are some of the things we’re going to do.",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-shop-talk-campaign-visit-detroit-michigan-transcript-september-22,Harris,"We need to also take the profit out of the criminal justice system.

Kamala Harris,00:18:34,"In terms of COVID, it’s really important to understand that in this election the contrast is as follows. On the one hand you have Donald Trump, who together with his boy Bill Barr are in the United States Supreme Court trying to end the Affordable Care Act that President Barack Obama together Vice President Biden passed. It was historic in terms of the magnitude of reform of the public health system in America. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, brought it so that over 20 million people who did not have access to healthcare could get access. Preexisting conditions. Black folks have a great number of preexisting conditions, see earlier part of the conversation. What they did with the Affordable Care Act is to say a person cannot be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. That’s a very big deal because people were being denied. Ask your relatives, your older relatives. People were being denied based on diabetes, based on high blood pressure. And that ended.",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-shop-talk-campaign-visit-detroit-michigan-transcript-september-22,Harris,"In terms of COVID, it’s really important to understand that in this election the contrast is as follows.

Kamala Harris,00:19:50,"Donald Trump’s in court right now trying to get rid of that. He’s in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act that said young people up to the age of 27 can be on their parents’ coverage. Well look, right now when we’re talking about the job prospects for people coming out of high school and college, they’re going to need health coverage, and that’s one way to keep it until they can get on their feet. And we’re talking about 7 million people, almost, who have contracted COVID, thank God haven’t died but have therefore, you can best believe, when they have to go for insurance and coverage, a preexisting condition. And if Donald Trump has his way, they can be denied. So when we look at this election, there are some very clear differences. Donald Trump will never use the term ‘black lives matter.’ He will never say that he will never say it.",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-shop-talk-campaign-visit-detroit-michigan-transcript-september-22,Harris,"Donald Trump’s in court right now trying to get rid of that.

Kamala Harris,00:20:47,"He will say that African countries are the word he used. He will say that when people are protesting for civil rights and justice, well they’re equal, on both sides, fine people. There are huge differences. Let’s talk about economic opportunities. Joe Biden and I are saying that we need to dedicate and will access to $150 billion for low interest loans and capital with a specific target for minority businesses. We’re saying there’ll be a $15,000 tax credit for first-time homeowners because we know the racial wealth gap is such that black families own 1/10 of the wealth of white families, and one of the greatest sources of our wealth intergenerationally is our ability to pass on that property from grandmother to grandson and so on and so on.

Kamala Harris,00:23:34,"Yes. Thank you, and thank you for your role of leadership. Part of it is I’m going to need your help, because one of the biggest problems on the topic that you have raised is the failure to speak truth about America’s history with race. Right now Donald Trump is trying to actually… You probably know this, Lieutenant Governor, tried to get rid of the training in the federal government on race, on specific aspects of race. Literally trying to wipe out history. They’re saying, there are senators and others who are saying that basically, essentially we should stop teaching the truth about racism in America. And so we have to talk about, one, we have to talk about the need to have leadership that speaks the truth. I will do that.

Kamala Harris,00:24:37,"For example, when we talk about, the other brother was asking about criminal justice. Let’s talk about America’s failure when it comes to understanding how you create safe communities. And by that I mean this. It is outdated, it is wrongheaded thinking to think that the only way you’re going to get communities to be safe is to put more police officers on the street. What we have to do and what we will do is reimagine public safety. In the way that you understand you want a safe community, you have to invest in the health and wellbeing of that community.

Kamala Harris,00:25:20,"You can go to any upper middle class suburb in America and you will not see the kind of police presence you see in other neighborhoods, but what you will see are well-funded public schools. What you will see are high rates of home ownership. What you will see are families who have an income that allows them to get through the end of the month without worrying about whether they can feed their children. What you will see are small businesses that have access to capital. What you will see are families that have access to healthcare that they can afford and mental health care that they can afford.

Kamala Harris,00:26:03,"Want to build safe communities, we need to invest in the health of communities. And that’s why we started talking about it earlier. A large part of our plan is about what we need to do to expand healthcare, what we need to do to expand access to capital. Part of it is what we need to do to increase Title I funding, which is the federal funding that goes to public schools that are in the communities with the lowest tax rates. So they’re getting the lowest amount of resources and we need to triple that.",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-shop-talk-campaign-visit-detroit-michigan-transcript-september-22,Harris,"Want to build safe communities, we need to invest in the health of communities.

Kamala Harris,00:26:29,"A big part of my focus has always been on what we need to do to expand mental health, because let’s talk about. We have so many of our children who have undiagnosed and untreated trauma, and it then manifests itself in all kinds of ways because we simply are not dealing with it. Because here’s the thing. Poverty is trauma inducing. Going to school or going to sleep at night and hearing gunfire and being told, “Baby, just jump in the bathtub to avoid the stray bullet,” is trauma inducing. And when we don’t address it, then it manifests itself in a number of ways. Whereas our children have such capacity that we are not tapping into because we are not giving communities the kind of mental health resources that we need. And we don’t talk about it. We don’t like to talk about it, but so many of our young people, Reverend Anthony, right now, are dealing with real serious depression, anxiety. And what happens? Any normal human being doesn’t like to feel pain. So you try and find ways to not feel the pain.

Kamala Harris,00:27:58,"So these are some of the examples of what we need to do and what I’m committed to doing. And it really does come down to not only a fight for justice and a fight for equality and freedom, but it also is about equity. So there’s a big difference between equality and equity. Equality suggest often everybody should get the same thing. Well, that often assumes everybody started out in the same place, as opposed to equity, which is everyone should end up in the same place. And if you then understand not everybody started out in the same place, you understand some people need more so we all end up in the same place.

Kamala Harris,00:28:46,"And so that’s about talking about equity and everything from education to healthcare, to economic status and ability to accumulate wealth. I will tell you, on the piece about the access to capital, look, Joe and I are fighting for a $15 minimum wage. We need a $15 minimum wage. But here’s the thing, brother. I’m going to say this, and I appreciate all the brothers and sisters from SEIU who’ve been fighting for that, that’s a given, but it’s a floor. Because nobody aspires to have a minimum wage job. That’s a floor. We need to build capital and an opportunity for people in our communities to build their wealth. We are a creative people. We are innovative. That’s why, you know, seven mile, this is a testament to that. And so that’s a large part of our focus too, is what we need to do around creating access to capital. And I appreciate you.

Kamala Harris,00:35:22,"That’s right. And I appreciate and thank you for all the leadership and the voice you always give working people.

Kamala Harris,00:35:44,"So that’s the floor, but it’s also what we need to do to recognize and respect the dignity of work, the value of hard work to all of the society, right? And then pay people their value. You talk about things like home healthcare workers and caregivers who do God’s work. They take care of the sick and the needy. They do it in a way that is physically and emotionally exhausting, and they need to be paid their value with all of the benefits that come with hard and good work, including sick leave, paid family leave, overtime.

Kamala Harris,00:37:26,"So these are some of the areas of focus for us. And then it’s about, again, paying people their value, because I can’t stress that enough, and understanding that the cost of living in America keeps going up, but wages have remained stagnant.

It will be about what we need to do to hold law enforcement, including prosecutors, accountable, and finally, my plan is about making sure that in America’s criminal justice system we de-incarcerate woman and children, that we end solitary confinement, and that we work on keeping families intact. And as President of the United States, knowing the system from the inside, I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete."

The program itself was named after a four year old boy who was shot and killed in gang violence while he slept in the pillow fort that he and his dad constructed."
Vice President Mike Pence,00:28:58,"So, we’ve supported law enforcement, but I couldn’t be more proud to be vice president to a president whose policies saw in our first three years the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African-Americans, the highest investment in historically Black colleges and universities, 8,000 opportunity zones in every major city attracting investment and jobs, and a president who has fought to let parents in our inner cities choose where their children go to school regardless of their income or area code. So we’re going to continue to support law enforcement, we’re going to continue to support our African-American families with better opportunities, better education, and more public safety. And under President Donald Trump, we’re going to have law and order in every city, in every state in this nation, for every American of every race, and creed, and color, so help us, God.

And I was alongside the president when the phone started to ring and he was preparing to keep that promise, Bob, and to say that virtually every leader in the world and every foreign policy elite in Washington, DC was against, would be an understatement.

And after spending an entire career since Roe vs. Wade, supporting what came to be known as the Hyde Amendment, a great piece of legislation by the late Henry Hyde that prevented taxpayer dollars from being used to pay for abortions in America, last year Joe Biden reversed his historic position in support of the Hyde Amendment and now supports taxpayer funding of abortion. I must tell you, and Ben mentioned how many tie-breaking votes I’ve cast as vice president, but I got to tell you, the one I’m proudest of was the day I was able to cast the tie-breaking vote in the United States Senate to allow states to defund planned parenthood, and President Donald Trump signed it into law.

So let me just say, these attacks on the freedom of religion must stop in America, and with four more years we will stand for the religious freedom of every American of every faith.

We’re going to stand for freedom. We’re going to deliver New Hampshire for four more years for President Donald Trump. But you got to get out and tell the story. And here’s the choice. I mean, it’s amazing to think in the middle of a global pandemic, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by $4 trillion. President Trump, we cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses, and we’re going to keep cutting taxes for four more years. That’s the choice. Joe Biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape. He’s got his own version of the Green New Deal.

Now I got to tell you, out in the heart land, we saw the impact of that trade deal. And he never lifted a finger to reform it or to renegotiate it.

I think my staff has indicated that she made no comments like that when she was serving on our team here at the White House Coronavirus Task Force. And I couldn’t be more proud of the work we’ve done all along the way and the leadership that President Trump has provided. I mean, from very early on, our President put the health of America first.

I think the choice in this election is whether America remains America. Whether we are going to chart a future based on the timeless ideals of freedom, personal responsibility, of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness or whether we’re going to take that hard left turn and take America down a path that you don’t need to look too far around the world to see in Western European social welfare states and the like."

I believe the rising generation is the pro-life generation and [inaudible 00:04:52] It’s been because with the support of Susan B. Anthony List, we’ve elected men and women at every level that supported life. We’ve enlisted a rising generation that’s embracing life as never before, in the history of this movement.
